# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=lambda a,b : a + b
print(x(a,b))
```

## Output

## Result
The program was executed successfully. It correctly defines a lambda function that takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum.
